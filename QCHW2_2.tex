For any integer t less than given k, we are able to eliminate t numbers of nodes in our directed graph to derive another directed graph without cycle.
So we need to declare bunch of variables.
Here is an array of acceptable ts, we name it k:
$$
k = [1, 2, 3, ... , k]
$$
And $x_i$ represents our nodes. if $x_i = 0$ that node has been selected to be deleted. and otherwise $x_i = 1$ is a servivor node.
There is a matrice E for primary graph representing edges. for every $e_{i,j}$ in matrice E if $e_{i,j} = 1$ it means node i is directed to node j.

The function below makes charges for eliminated node number beeing more than k:
\begin{equation}
k - \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1-x_i
\end{equation}

And for every cycle of length L we have the cost functions represented as shown:
\begin{align}
L&=3 \\
&\sum_{l=1}^{n}\sum_{m=1}^{n}\sum_{p=1}^{n} e_{l,m}e_{m,p}e_{l,p}(x_l*x_m+x_m*x_p+x_p*x_l)  \\
L&=4 \\
&\sum_{l=1}^{n}\sum_{m=1}^{n}\sum_{p=1}^{n}\sum_{q=1}^{n} e_{l,m}e_{m,p}e_{p,q}e_{q,l}(x_l *x_m +x_m * x_p +x_p *x_q +x_q *x_l) \\
&\vdots \\
L&=n-k \\ 
&\sum_{l=1}^{n}\sum_{m=1}^{n} \cdots \sum_{p=1}^{n} e_{l,m} \cdots e_{p,l}(x_l*x_m+ \cdots + x_p*x_l)
\end{align}

\end{document}
